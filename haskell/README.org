#+TITLE: Haskell development environment

Setup steps:

Create a new directory
#+begin_src shell
  mkdir /development/project
#+end_src

Copy =Dockerfile= and =docker-compose.yml= to your new directory
#+begin_src shell
  cp Dockerfile docker-compose.yml /development/project
#+end_src

Build the development container; the container name is =dev-env-haskell=.
#+begin_src shell
  cd /development/project
  docker compose up -d --build
#+end_src

Wrap the tools you desire with shell scripts to invoke the tools
within the container, for example to call =cabal= save the wrapper
bellow in a folder listed within your =PATH= variable:
#+begin_src shell
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  docker exec -it haskell-dev cabal "$@"
#+end_src
